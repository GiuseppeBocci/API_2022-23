# API_2022-23
Algorithms and Data Structures (API) project 2022/23 at Politecnico di Milano

## Educational objectives and implementation
### Goals
- Practical application of the techniques learned in the algorithms module e
data structures of the algorithms and principles of computer science course
- Implementing a solution to a problem by paying attention to
concrete aspects of code efficiency
### Realization
- C language (C11, VLA allowed)
- No external libraries beyond the C standard library
- No multithreading
- Input data received via stdin, results to be provided via stdout
